# DuckBehaviour
This project contains three interfaces which are the Fly Behaviour, Swim Behaviour and QuackBehaviour. 
The base class Duck implements these interfaces with the methods written in them along with extending a class to display duck's name
The classes DecoyDuck, MallardDuck, RubberDuck and readheadedDuck are types of ducks which extend the base class duck and display their own characteristics.
